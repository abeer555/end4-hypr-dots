## Overview
A focused Hyprland dotfiles collection built on **end-4** — aimed at providing usable defaults with aesthetic polish. Small, opinionated set of configs and helper scripts to streamline workspace startup and input passthrough.

## Features
- Windows autostart in a silent workspace (auto-launch selected apps on startup)  
- Custom keybinding passthrough (preserve and forward key combos)  
- Clipboard passthrough (share clipboard between contexts)  

## TODO
- [ ] Refine and Add Dots — finalize and organize dotfiles for distribution  
- [ ] Add `win-apps.conf` — per-app window rules and autostart entries  
- [ ] Refine Quickshell more — polish quick-launch shell and keybindings  
- [ ] Add automated install — create an installer (backup + deploy)
